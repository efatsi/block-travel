# Block travel package

## NO LONGER MAINTAINED

Unfortunately this package is no longer maintained. Please
contact me if you'd like to take over maintenance or can
suggest an alternative.

through blocks of code.

* `alt-up` to travel up through blocks of code
* `alt-down` to travel down through blocks of code
* `alt-shift-up` to travel and select up through blocks of code
* `alt-shift-down` to travel and select down through blocks of code
